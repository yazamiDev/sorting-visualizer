# Sorting Visualizer

This repository illustrates the effectiveness and performance of popular sorting algorithms. Sorting is one of the fundementable building blocks in Computer Science. It is the process of organizing elements of a data set in a particular order. Not only does sorting reduce the complexity of a problem but also makes searching data faster. This project demonstrates algorithmic techniques, detailed analysis, and effective use cases. Enjoy learning!

## Algorithms Implemented

Selection Sort<br/>
Insertion Sort<br/>
Bubble Sort<br/>
Heap Sort<br/>
Merge Sort<br/>
Quick Sort<br/>

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
